# Software-engineering summary
*software includes*
  - an executable program and its data
  - Configuration files
  - System documentation
  - Support environment

*Different kinds of Software*
  - Application SW:
    + interacts directly with the end user
    + is used for general purpose SW as well as customized SW for specific purposes
  - System-level SW:
    + does not interface with the end user
    + keeps a system running 
  - SW as aService (SaaS):
    + runs on a server
    + indirectly accessed via client
   
*Project phases*
  - analysis
  - design
  - evaluation of design
  - construction
  - quality control

*Requirement types*
  - User requirements:
    + services ecpected to be provided by the system
    + operational contraints
  - System requirements:
    + determine the system interface; define solution space
    + refinement of user requirements
  - Functional requirements:
    + specify services to be provided by the system
    + specify system reations to dpecific inputs/events
    + specify system behavior in specific situations
  - Non-functional requirements:
    + contraints on the services or functions offered by the systen, including: Service-level agreement, Contraints from development process, Alignment to standards
  - Doamin requirements:
  - + derived from application domain
   
*Loop of requirements elicitation and analysis*:
  1. requirements discovery
  2. requirements classification and organisation
  3. requirements prioritisation and negotiabtion
  4. requirements documentation
